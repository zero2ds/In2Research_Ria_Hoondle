This week I explored the ggplot2 package allowing me to create bar charts, scatter diagrams and choropleth maps, after creating the graph I was able to demonstrate statistics provided by the World health Organisation on incedences of Malaria in 2020. I was able to do this by exploring data already provided within R on longitudes and lattitudes of all countries and then by using the left_join() function to combine my data set on Malaria with this data frame accordingly. I was then able to use the scale_fill_gradient() function in order to clearly highlight countries with the greatest number of incidences. In general I have found subsetting data tables and editing them using the left_join and rbind() functions very useful. Installing the packages tidyverse and reshape2 also helped in this process.
