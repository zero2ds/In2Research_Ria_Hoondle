# Ria's Week 3 progress - Summary 
The following information can be found more detail in the word document posted - Week 3 report.

This week I have been exploring descriptive statistics including skewness, kurtosis, running correlation tests, t-tests and attempting chi-squared tests. I also explored plotting grouped boxplots based on the healthcare WHO data.

The boxplots above demonstrate the range of Global life expectancy values from the years 2000-2019 for both males and females.

This scatter plot demonstrates the negative correlation coefficient between the number of doctors available per 10,000 citizens of the country against the percentage probability of being diagnosed with cancer from the ages of 30-70. From the word document attached the values for the Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient can be read which provide evidence for the negative correlation.

In these two correlation matricies, I have plotted the correlation coefficient values by colour to allow trends to be idenitified more easily. Here I have investigated the correlation between several variable pairs such as number of available doctors, cancer cases, road traffic deaths and basic sanitation available.
